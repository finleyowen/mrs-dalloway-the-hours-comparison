						&ldquo;Virginia Woolf was great fun at parties. I want

						years ago this year, is so often portrayed as the Dark

					<h2>Social life</h2>
					<p>
						Biographical accounts of Woolf&#39;s life (Auden 1954,
						Heitman 2015) provide descriptions of her as rebellious
						and non-conventional, with a passionate social life and
						centre-left political opinions. She was a member of the
						Bloomsbury group which consisted of authors, visual
						artists, designers, art critics and other creative
						figures. Another member was Vanessa Bell, Woolf&#39;s
						sister, who plays an important part in the film ‘The
						Hours’ which will be discussed later. The group famously
						valued personal relationships over politics and power.
						They were not artistically collaborative, nor did their
						art contain common themes that can be associated with
						membership of the group. It seems, in fact, that the
						only things they had in common were their Cambridge
						educations, upper-middle-class social statuses, and
						their friendship based on liberalism and art (Tate,
						n.d.). Coincidentally, my own mother was born near
						Bloomsbury, about three minutes by car from where the
						Woolfs lived (though years after their deaths). This
						supports my hypothesis that had Virginia been alive
						today, we&#39;d definitely be pals.

					<h2>Relationships and other works</h2>
					<p>
						Amoung her popular works are <i>The Waves</i>, which is
						about a group of six close friends and explores ideas of
						time and separation in non-conventional ways;
						<i>A Room of One&#39;s Own</i>, an extended feminist
						essay about the way women are restricted socially; and
						<i>Orlando: A Biography</i>, which follows an aspiring
						poet who lives for hundreds of years and during which
						time undergoes a magical and unexplainable change of
						sex. <br />
						The latter is described by Jenette Winterson for The
						Guardian as a &ldquo;trans triumph&rdquo; and can be
						seen as a piece of queer activism, since it is one of
						the earliest literary works to document a character who
						changes sex and has relationships with men and women at
						various points in their lifetime. It&#39;s dedicated to
						Woolf&#39;s own long-term same-sex partner, Vita
						Sackville-West, and Woolf&#39;s diary describes the
						novel as &ldquo;A biography beginning in the year 1500
						and continuing to the present day, called Orlando. Vita;
						only with a change about from one sex to the
						other.&rdquo; (Winterson 2018).

					<h2>The darkness</h2>
					<p>
						So far, we&#39;ve focused on the brighter aspects of
						Woolf&#39;s life. However, it wasn&#39;t all fun and
						games for Virginia or her husband, Leonard. Woolf
						experienced severe mental health issues for almost her
						whole life. She had her first nervous breakdown at
						fifteen years old, following the deaths of her mother
						and half-sister. She continued to be prone to
						manic/depressive episodes, and &ldquo;lived in fear of
						her next mental breakdown&rdquo;. Leonard noticed that
						&ldquo;while Virginia was writing a novel, she was sane
						and in the manic period of her manic-depression.
						However, soon after her novel was complete, she became
						depressed&rdquo; (Holm 2018). She also experienced
						forced institutionalisation multiple times and attempted
						suicide twice (Klopfenstein 2021).
					</p>
					<p>
						But the story gets darker. New and disturbing details
						have emerged quite recently about traumatic experiences
						from Woolf&#39;s childhood. Specifically, that she was
						sexually violated at a young age by her own
						half-brothers. It occurred only once before the death of
						her father, but then continuously for five years
						afterwards. According to Gillian Gill, author of
						<i>Virginia Woolf and the Women Who Shaped Her World</i
						>, &ldquo;By her own account, it had a lifelong effect
						on her and we see this when she&#39;s in her 40s and she
						writes about it in her memoirs in 1939&rdquo; (Haynes
						2018). Gill also says that the claims were extremely
						controversial when they were uncovered by the public
						eye, with skeptics saying her &lsquo;madness&rsquo;
						caused her to make the claims up.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then, in 1941, Woolf wrote a letter to her husband
						saying: &ldquo;Dearest, I feel certain I am going mad
						again. I feel we can&#39;t go through another of those
						terrible times. And I shan&#39;t recover this
						time.&rdquo; This was the beginning of her suicide note.
						Woolf drowned herself in 1941, with stones in her
						pockets and no witnesses.
					</p>
					<h2>The conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						We can trace patterns in Woolf&#39;s life and thereby
						make predictions about what her exploration of happiness
						could have involved. Most definitively, we can say that
						Woolf explored happiness through her writing, or at
						least that writing was something that made her happy.
						I&#39;d argue that deviancy in general was another thing
						that brought her joy. We observe deviancy in her social
						circles, novels, and relationships; all of which were
						known sources of happiness for her. I&#39;d also say
						that devotion and love/friendship were values of hers
						because of what we know about the Bloomsbury group as
						well as her personal relationships (i.e., Leonard and
						Vita).

						In <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>, Woolf uses fictitious characters

						For example, the climax of the novel is the death of
						ex-war veteran Septimus Warren-Smith by suicide. This
						event is inherently heartbreaking, especially when we
						consider the way Woolf herself passed away, and the way
						she felt for a lot of her life. But I believe its
						importance lies in its timing; why, of all times, does
						he take his life the moment Dr. Holmes arrives to take
						him somewhere where he might recover from his illness?
						The best explanation seems to be that Woolf is making a
						commentary on the mental health institutionalisation and
						forced treatment she experienced herself. Luke Holm
						wrote for Owlcation: &ldquo;The doctors who treated her
						gave her anxiety. The treatments they prescribed for her
						were unsuccessful and torturous. . . By the end of
						Virginia’s treatments, she could no longer cope with her
						normal life.&rdquo; (Holm 2018). Knowing this, Mrs
						Dalloway can be compared to Sylvia Plath&#39;s
						<b

							title="The Bell Jar is about a young woman who has a nervous breakdown and is sent to multiple mental health recovery centers. The main character, Esther, documents things she believes are wrong with the way she&#39;s treated in the mental assylum including her experiences with shock treatment, the price of psychotherapists and restrictions in the hospital."
							><i>The Bell Jar</i></b
						>, which sends a rather different (though still bleak
						and disturbing) message about forced
						institutionalisation for people experiencing mental
						illness.
					</p>
					<p>
						The repetition with variation of the phrase &ldquo;down
						into the flames&rdquo; in excerpts about Septimus&#39;
						sense of impending doom could be read in contrast with
						the repetition of the poem:
						<b
							id="fear-no-more"
							onclick="describe('fear-no-more')"
							title="The poem is written by William Shakespeare and appears in his play: Cymbeline"
							>&ldquo;Fear no more the heat o&#39; the
							sun&rdquo;</b
						>
						in <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>. The poem is about triumph and
						bravery, two things that Septimus seems to be sapped dry
						of by the time the novel is set. However, the poem is
						also about not fearing death; “The scepter, learning,
						physic, must / All follow this, and come to dust.” This
						is a parallel theme in Septimus’ last moments, as shown
						by the line “Fear no more, says the heart in the body;
						fear no more. He was not afraid” (Woolf 1925).
					</p>
					<p>
						Parallels can also be drawn between Clarissa Dalloway
						and Woolf herself. Clarissa seems to experience similar
						intrusive thoughts as Virginia is described to have
						experienced; &ldquo;She had a perpetual sense, as she
						watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea
						and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very,
						very dangerous to live even one day&rdquo; (Woolf 1925).
						Clarissa is also described early in the novel by Scrope
						Purvis, a minor character, as having &ldquo;grown very
						white since her illness&rdquo;. Though her illness is
						never elaborated upon, we can read between the lines
						here and speculate that Clarissa may have suffered a
						nervous breakdown, much like those that Woolf suffered.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6 page">
					<p>
						Clarissa also cares a lot about her parties. This could
						be interpreted as an unimportant part of the novel (who
						doesn&#39;t care about their parties?) but I don&#39;t
						believe it to be so. The point is made so many times
						throughout the novel (&ldquo;it was a very odd thing how
						much Clarissa minded about her parties, [Peter]
						thought&rdquo;), that I&#39;d argue that Clarissa cares
						about her parties in a similar way Woolf cared about
						writing. I think the parties are a sacred space for
						Clarissa, who is confined to the

							title="The &lsquo;separate sphere&rsquo; model of gender inequality is the idea that women inhabit the domestic sphere while men inhabit the public sphere. The domestic sphere refers to the realm of cooking, cleaning, and providing; while the public sphere refers to that of politics, intellectualism, and war."
							>domestic sphere</b
						>
						by her position as an upper-middle class woman in the
						early 20th century. The parties are her time to shine in
						front of the public sphere and feel important by
						receiving praise and acceptance from seemingly important
						and influential figures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another way Woolf expresses her happiness and
						individuality in the novel is through her political
						opinions, which were probably influenced by her
						association with the Bloomsbury group. The novel is
						commonly known for its progressiveness in that the plot
						centers around events that take place within the
						domestic sphere. This focus takes attention away from
						politics and power, which were the ideological enemies
						of the Bloomsbury group. This is evident when Mrs.
						Walker, the cook of the Dalloways&#39; house, expresses
						that the Prime Minister coming to dinner &ldquo;made no
						difference at this hour of the night… among the plates,
						saucepans, cullenders, frying-pans&rdquo; (Woolf 1925).
						This is just one example of Woolf uplifting and
						empowering her characters who abide in the domestic
						sphere, in this case for a career, while simultaneously
						disparaging the importance of the public sphere, of
						which the Prime Minister is symbolic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Woolf also makes political commentary through Septimus,
						who raises ideas about life and death in a capitalist
						and democratic society. &ldquo;The fallen, he said, they
						tear to pieces.&rdquo; This is interesting because
						(though he&#39;s talking about someone who laughed at
						his writing), it&#39;s a dominant criticism made of
						<b

							title="This school of thought, when applied, says the best way to distribute resources ‘practically’ to humans, and to prevent the human population passing an imagined ‘crisis point’, is to cut of healthcare and essential services to those who prone to ‘falling through the cracks’ of society; essentially the poor, the shellshocked, and the minority population."
							>Malthusian philosophy</b
						>, which is deeply entrenched in our social and economic
						systems and was gaining popularity at the time Mrs
						Dalloway was written. While it&#39;s not likely that
						Woolf meant this directly as a philosophical criticism,
						I think she chose her words carefully when speaking of
						Septimus&#39; illness, and it may be true that some of
						Septimus&#39; revelations and delusions are based on
						things that she thought or experienced herself. So, the
						relevance of Malthusian philosophy to
						<i>Mrs Dalloway</i> lies not in its political imact, but
						its ideology, which is likely to have a lot in common
						with the ideological stigma around mental illness that
						Woolf and Septimus alike experienced.

					<p>
						Generally, I think a film is less likely to portray a
						character&#39;s life in a positive light if it begins
						with a scene of the character taking their own life.
						Furthermore, I think a film is less likely to provide an
						accurate representation of a true story if it begins
						with a scene that was not witnessed by anyone.
						&lsquo;The Hours&rsquo; is no exception. It begins with
						a scene of Woolf&#39;s suicide (played by Nicole Kidman)
						and abounds in misrepresentation and misinformation
						about her life and work.
					</p>
					<p>
						One example is the way it depicts the relationship
						between Virginia and Leonard. In the film, Leonard is
						often shown trying to &lsquo;tame&rsquo; Virginia. He
						feels he must force her to eat lunch, allow her to go
						for a walk, he even seems hesitant to let Virginia
						write, when we know the real Leonard encouraged her to
						write, because that&#39;s what made her happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Richmond Train Station, when Leonard says to
						Virginia, &ldquo;We set up the printing press. . . so
						that you might have a ready source of absorption and a
						remedy,&rdquo; he makes a clear distinction between the
						&lsquo;we&rsquo; who set up the printing press, and the
						&lsquo;you&rsquo; who needs a ready source of absorption
						and a remedy. But according to Duncan Heyes for the
						British Library, &ldquo;There were a number of reasons
						why the Woolfs were keen to start printing. In his
						autobiography, Leonard stated that he wanted a
						distraction for Virginia to give her a break from the
						intellectual effort of writing. . . Despite both Leonard
						and Virginia&#39;s enthusiasm for printing, the Hogarth
						Press was only ever meant to be a hobby; it was not
						intended to grow into a full-time publishing
						enterprise&rdquo; (Heyes 2016). While this is evidence
						that the printing press served as a &ldquo;ready source
						of absorption&rdquo; for Virginia, there seems to be no
						separation of the sort that Leonard in the film makes
						(&ldquo;the Woolfs were keen to start printing&rdquo;,
						&ldquo;both Leonard and Virginia&rdquo;). This shows
						that the film portrays their relationship as controlling
						and power-orientated, but the evidence that their
						relationship was really like that is lacking. In fact,
						we could speak of evidence to the contrary, such as
						their association with the Bloomsbury group who opposed
						ideas of power in general, and the same-sex affair that
						Virginia had while happily married to Leonard.
					</p>
					<p>
						The kiss between Woolf and Vanessa also feels like an
						unnecessary and frankly offensive lie about Woolf&#39;s
						life. Woolf was not known to ever kiss her sister, nor
						is there any evidence that she wanted to or would have
						done had she the chance. In
						<i>The Hours</i> (on which &lsquo;The Hours&ldquo; is
						based), the event is described as &ldquo;an innocent
						kiss, innocent enough, but just now, in this kitchen,
						behind Nelly&#39;s back, it feels like the most
						delicious and forbidden of pleasures. Vanessa returns
						the kiss.&rdquo; (Cunningham 1998) This, I have a no
						problem with, mainly because it doesn&#39;t portray
						Woolf as an incestuous pervert. In the film, however,
						the kiss feels completely unwarranted, occurs in front
						of Nessa&#39;s youngest child, and makes Nessa quite
						uncomfortable. It&#39;s there to reinforce how far
						Woolf&#39;s mindset and actions have crossed the
						socially acceptable line, and I would argue that scenes
						like this fed into the popular opinion that was held
						until quite recently that non-heterosexual identities
						are intrinsically inferior and potentially unacceptable.

								Besides the inaccuracies of the Virginia Woolf
								character, however, the film does deal with some
								serious and complicated themes, and parallels
								can be drawn between it and <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>.
								For example, there&#39;s the death of Richard,
								who dies by suicide the same way Septimus does.
								His death is also the climax of the story, and
								it too occurs at strange timing (specifically,
								when Clarissa arrives to help prepare him for
								the party). However, I feel strongly that the
								meaning of Septimus&#39; death in Mrs Dalloway
								was exactly that, the timing. As Is&#39;ve said,
								it was an important and meaningful commentary
								about the like of Dr. Holmes and forced mental
								health treatment. In the film, however, there is
								no suggestion of any commentary, no meaning
								behind the tragedy. Its&#39;s just sad.
							</p>
							<p>
								Richards&#39;s last words are &ldquo;I don&#39;t
								think two people could have been happier than
								we&#39;ve been.&rdquo; These are familiar words
								because they were also the last words of
								Virginia&#39;s letter to Leonard, but I really
								struggle to find meaning in the artistic
								decisions that were made around Richard&#39;s
								death. What is the message here? That
								award-winning authors die by suicide? That
								Clarissa and Richard should have eloped while
								they had the chance so that maybe he
								wouldn&#39;t have caught HIV and lost his mind?
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course, the party doesn&#39;t go ahead after
								all (how can it?). What was, in the novel, a
								neat conclusion to the story simply does not
								occur in &lsquo;The Hours&rsquo;, and the
								audience are almost left with more questions
								than they had halfway through the film. We find
								out that Laura&#39;s son, Richie from 1951 also
								happens to be Clarissa&#39;s friend, Richard
								from 2001; that Laura, after struggling with her
								own mental health and social expectations,
								eventually left both of her children, and had
								been planning to do so since the day of
								Richard&#39;s father&#39;s birthday in 1951. We
								feel her guilt and shame and empathise with her
								pain, but the meaning of this confession is hard
								to gauge. We never learn how Richard felt about
								his mother leaving, nor see the two of them
								reunite in his adulthood. There&#39;s no clear
								message, no resolution, no party to make it all
								worth it. It seems that if there’s a lesson to
								be learned from the film, it&#39;s about
								&ldquo;window boxes and hedges; about wives
								walking pugs; about clock striking the hours in
								empty rooms&rdquo; (Cunningham 1998).

							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>
								To sum up, part of what makes
								<i>Mrs Dalloway</i> as magical as I believe it
								to be is the nuances it contains; what&#39;s
								written between the lines. The content of these
								hidden meanings is generally darker than the way
								they&#39;re conveyed; for example, Clarissa
								<i>really</i> cares about her parties (because
								she struggles to find other things to care
								about); the timing of Septimus&#39; death is
								unfortunate (because he&#39;s terrified of the
								doctors whose job is to &lsquo;help&rsquo; him).
								But I felt these nuances were absent in the
								film, unless I wasn&#39;t looking hard enough.
								This could be attributed to the different
								formats, since it&#39;s surely harder to write
								between the lines of a film than a novel. But
								the portrayal of Virginia Woolf, world-renowned
								literary icon, as defective, childish, and
								unable to look after herself? I don&#39;t
								attribute that to format. I attribute it to the
								stigma that surrounds mental illness and the
								producer&#39;s money-thirsty attempt to attract
								viewer attention.

								We&#39;ve seen how similarities and differences
								between the two texts affected the way we
								percieved them, such as how the hidden message
								behind Septimus&#39; death caused me to be
								disappointed by the lack of a message in
								Richard&#39;s death in &lsquo;The Hours&rsquo;.
								Similarly, we&#39;ve seen how contrasts in the
								plots affect the way we perceived them, like how
								the party never happens in &lsquo;The
								Hours&rsquo; while in
								<i>Mrs Dalloway</i> it&#39;s an important part
								of the novel; namely, the resolution. My overall
								interpretation of the extent to which each
								amplify/diminish Woolf&#39;s exploration of
								happiness is that <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> amplifies
								it, by empowering Woolf to express her authentic
								self through her artwork, while &lsquo;The
								Hours&rsquo; diminishes it, by altering her
								legacy through its inaccurate portrayal of the
								author, and representing her story in a way that
								isn&#39;t as meaningful as her own.
