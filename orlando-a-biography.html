					<h1><i>Orlando: a Biography</i> by Virginia Woolf</h1>
					<p>
						Orlando: A Biography dives deep into what it means to be
						a man or to be a woman and contains some fascinating
						insights such as &ldquo;The change of sex, though it
						altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter
						their identity.&rdquo; (Woolf 1928). Interestingly, this
						quote is the only passage in the novel where Woolf uses
						the singular &lsquo;they&rsquo;, the gender-neutral
						personal pronoun; before this point she refers to
						Orlando using masculine pronouns and afterwards,
						feminine.
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple times in the story, after Orlando's sex changes
						and she begins to understand women’s roles in society,
						she says that she will “forswear society forever”. She
						even compares her friends to dogs, saying “All these
						months that I’ve been out in the world, … I’ve heard
						nothing but what Pippin might have said. I’m cold. I’m
						happy. I’m hungry. I’ve caught a mouse. I’ve buried a
						bone. Please kiss my nose.” Knowing about the Bloomsbury
						group’s contempt for high society, politics, and power,
						this appears to be Woolf expressing her own view on
						society through her fictitious character.
